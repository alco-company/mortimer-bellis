  # if the view is a standard CRU(d) view, the form can be generated
  # by trusting the inherited form method off of the ApplicationRecord
  # class. If the form is more complex, a custom form class can be
  # created in the app/views/{models} directory - fx app/views/pages/form.rb
  # defining Pages::Form < ApplicationForm - either defining every field
  # or calling form_fields fields: [ :slug, :title, :content ]
  # or uncomment the following method and adjust the fields
  #
  # def self.form(resource:, editable: true)
  #   Pages::Form.new resource: resource, editable: editable, fields: [ :slug, :title, :content ]
